<h1><strong>Attention</strong></h1><br>
<br>You've been runnin' round, runnin' round, runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name<br>
<br>'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up<br>
<br>You've been going round, going round, going round every party in L.A.<br>
<br>'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh<br><br>
<blockquote>I know that dress is karma, perfume regret</blockquote><br>
<br>You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, oh<br>
<br>And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?<br><br>But you're not coming home with me tonight<br>
<br>You just want attention, you don't want my heart<br>
<br>Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new<br>
<br>Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start<br>
<br>You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you<br><br><br><br>- <em>Charlie Puth</em><br>
